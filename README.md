Phase Equilibrium has significant importance in physical and biological sciences. The study of Phase Equilibrium relates quantitatively the variables that describe the state of equilibrium of two or more homogeneous phases that are free to exchange energy and matter. As it reaches the state of equilibrium, it thus obtains the corresponding equilibrium plots in Pressure-Temperature-composition space. Theoretical developments in molecular thermodynamics lead to the discovery of Van Laar, NRTL, Wilson activity coefficient models to describe the liquid phase behavior at low pressure and Vanderwaals, Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich Kwong Equations of state to describe the gas phase behavior of a real system. The current project shows the comparison of these models for different binary systems at isobaric and isothermal condiitions to conclude the optimal combination of the models to predict the vapor-liquid equilibrium.
